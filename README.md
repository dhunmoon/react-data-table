# react-data-table
This is a very basic code written by a beganner coder and there are things which is still WIP.


# Dependencies

Currently it is dependent on 
1. `React` (as it is only ment to be used in react),
2. `office-uifavric-react`, which is an React package from Microsoft as part of it's Fleuent UI Framework. I am planning on removing that dependency in future.
3. It's also dependent upon an custom helper method pacjage which I have written.(that is WIP)


# Configuration


```javascript
var sampleConfig = {
    columns: [
        {//fully loaded column config
            key: `<STRING>`, //REQUIRED: column key from data
            title: `<STRING>`,//Title of the column : if not available then key will be used as the title.
            type: `<STRING>`,//this is not in use for use and I don't remember what was the plan dor this.
            search: true, //if this is set to true then user will have option to search a column.
            shorting: true, //if this is set to true then user will have option to short each column.
            render: function(cellData,rowData){//this function will return a component or data.
                return <Component/>
            },
            value: function(cellData,rowData){//this function will be used to resolve any complex values like arrays or objects.
                //this will return a primitive value calculated using the data received 
                //If
                return `<PRIMITIVE/>`;
            },
        },

    /*
    These are additional buttons which are added to the table layout

    buttons: [{

    pagination: 5, //if you want a pagination then pass a number and then that many pages will get created.
}
```



## FYFilter


1. Just passing true will use 'FY' will get filtered and unique values from the same column will be used to get values.
```javascript
  haveFyFilter: true, // which means column name 'FY' will get filtered and unique values from the same column will be used to populate the filter options,
  ```

  2. User can also pass object which will have

  This object will have information about which column to choose, what title should the column should have and values column should have and how to filter the data.

  ```javascript
  haveFyFilter : {
      key: 'FY', //key which is being to apply filter
      //if check function in not there then values will be used directly to do the check.
      title: 'Placeholder Text',
      check: function check(data) {
          //apply this data check on the filter
      }
      values: [], //list of values to be shown in the filter. if this is not here then 
      //or values can be a function
      values: () => {return [];} //which will return arrays of values should be in the dropdown.
      //values form FY column will be used to generate the list.
  }
  ```
